We prove a form of Church-Rosser for the safe part of a term: 
if $t \reduces u$ and $t \reduces v$ then there are $w$, $z$ such that 
$u \reduces w$ and $v \reduces z$ and $w$, $v$ are equal outside the right-hand side of all $\cond$-
sub-terms.

We define the safe trunk of a term as the part of the term which we can normalize with safe reductions only.
In the rest of this section we will
prove that Safe Church-Rosser implies that if the safe trunk exists then it is unique. 

Safe Church-Rosser and Safe strong Normalization together imply that after finitely many steps
all safe reductions reach the same safe trunk.

\begin{definition}[Safe Trunk of a term]
\label{definition-safe-trunk}
Assume $t \in \LAMBDA$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The safe trunk of $t$ is any expression $u[\cond(f_1,\cdot), \ldots, \cond(f_n,\cdot)]$
such that  for some $g_1, \ldots, g_n$ we have $v = u[\cond(f_1,g_1), \ldots, \cond(f_n,g_n)]$
\emph{safe normal} and $t \reduces v$.
\item
$t$ is \emph{finite for safe reduction} if and only if all infinite reduction sequences from $t$ 
include only finitely many \quotationMarks{safe} reduction steps.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[Safe Trunk of a term]
\label{lemma-safe-trunk}
Assume $t$ is finite for safe reductions.
If the  safe-trunk of $t$ exists then it is unique. 
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Assume $t$ is finite for safe reductions in order to prove that the safe-trunk of $t$ is unique.

Assume that $u[\cond(f_1,\cdot), \ldots, \cond(f_n,\cdot)]$ and
$u'[\cond(f'_1,\cdot), \ldots, \cond(f'_{n'},\cdot)]$ are safe-trunks for $t$, in order to prove
that $u=u'$ and $n=n'$. 

Then for some $g_1, \ldots,g_n$ and some $g'_1, \ldots,g'_n$ we have that 
$v = u[\cond(f_1,g_1), \ldots, \cond(f_n,g_n)]$ and 
$v' = u'[\cond(f'_1,g'_1), \ldots, \cond(f'_n,g'_{n'})]$ 
are safe-normal forms of $t$ and all $\cond$-expressions shown are maximal. 
The decomposition of each safe-normal form $v$ is therefore unique:
if $v = u"[\cond(f"_1,g"_1), \ldots, \cond(f"_n,g"_{n"})]$ then $u=u"$ and $n=n"$
and $f_1=f"_1$, \ldots, $f_n=f"_n$.
Each reduction from $v$, $v'$ takes place in some $g_1, \ldots,g'_{n'}$. 

By Safe Church-Rosser  (first part of this section) we deduce that $v$ and $v'$ are confluent
outside the right-hand-side of $\cond$-expressions, therefore
for some $v"$ we have $v \reduces v"$ and $v' \reduces v'"$. 
Since the reductions on $v, v'$ take place in some $g_1, \ldots,g'_{n'}$, 
we deduce that $v" = u[\cond(f_1,g"_1), \ldots, \cond(f_n,g"_n)]$
and $v'" = u[\cond(f'_1,g'"_1), \ldots, \cond(f'_n,g'"_{n'})]$ for some $g"_1, \ldots,g'"_{n'}$.
From the unicity of the decomposition of $v"$
with maximal $\cond$-subterms we conclude that $u=u'$ and $n=n'$
and and $f_1=f'_1$, \ldots, $f_n=f'_n$, as wished.

\end{proof}
