\begin{abstract}
We explore the possibility of having a circular syntax
directly for $\lambda$-abstraction and simple types, instead of interpreting
 $\lambda$-abstraction through combinators and inserting a  circular syntax afterwards.
We introduce our circular syntax as a fixed point operator defined by cases.
Our motivation for using binders instead of combinators is that this way of introducing circular syntax 
could be more familiar for researchers working in the field of Type Theory.

We prove the expected results for this circular simply typed $\lambda$-calculus, which we call $\CTlambda$: 
every closed term of type $\N$ reduces to some numeral;
strong normalization for all reductions sequences outside all fixed points; 
 strong normalization for ``fair'' reductions; Church-Rosser property;
and the equivalence with G\"{o}del system $\systemT$. 

Besides, terms of $\CTlambda$ are much shorter than the equivalent terms written in $\systemT$.
